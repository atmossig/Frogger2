<P>These guidelines are presented in the hope of making the skin plugin easier
to use and minimising potential problems which could occur later. Any user of
the skin plugin is invited to contribute to this section for the benefit of
all.</P>
<P>A debug log file is created while using the skin plugin called
c:\skinDebug.log.</P>
<P>If you have any problems whilst using this plugin, please send me the
following: the file you were working on, the debug log, and a short message
describing what you were doing or intended to do.</P>
<BR>
<P STYLE="border-bottom: thin black solid"><B>Before Using The Skin PlugIn</B> 
</P>
<P>If after you have copied the plugin into you MAX plugins directory and you
find it isn't available in the Create / SpaceWarps menu you probably need to
copy <A HREF="file:///X|/TechTeam/MaxPlugIns/Msvcrtd.dll">Msvcrtd.dll</A> into
your Windows / System directory. If the file already exists, don't bother
overwriting the file. This file is used internally for debug logging. </P>
<BR>
<P STYLE="border-bottom: thin black solid"><B>General Use</B> </P>
<P>Always make sure that you are using the latest version of the plugin before
reporting any problems.</P>
<BR>
 <P STYLE="border-bottom: thin black solid"><B>Preparing An Object For
Skinning</B> </P>
<P>Although it is perfectly acceptable to add a skin to any object, it is
recommended the user convert the object to an editable mesh before binding.</P>
<P>It is also recommended that before adding a skin to an object that the
objects &quot;Pivot&quot; transform is reset to identity. Use the
<A HREF="../../Index.htm#Pivot%20Reset">Pivot</A> plugin for this purpose. </P>
<BR>
<P STYLE="border-bottom: thin black solid"><B>Creating The Skeleton</B> </P>
<P>When constructing the bone skeleton for the skinned object, make sure the
&quot;Assign To Children&quot; check box under the &quot;IK Controller&quot; in
&quot;Bone Parameters&quot; is cleared. The image below shows the correct bone
creation panel.</P>
<IMG SRC="bone%20create.jpg" ALT="{short description of image}" WIDTH="179"
 HEIGHT="459" BORDER="0"><P>For the moment the only animation method supported
is linear, so make sure the default assign controller is linear. The image
below shows what the assign controller should be like for all bones used</P>
<IMG SRC="bone%20assign.jpg" ALT="{short description of image}" WIDTH="181"
 HEIGHT="327" BORDER="0"> <P>Make sure that before assigning vertices to bones,
that key frame zero (the reference frame) have their scale and rotate values at
identity. The images below show what the scale and rotate values should be for
all the bones at frame zero.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="bone%20frame0%20-%20scale.jpg" ALT="{short description of image}"
WIDTH="295" HEIGHT="126" BORDER="0" ALIGN="TEXTTOP"><IMG
SRC="bone%20frame0%20-%20rotate.jpg" ALT="{short description of image}"
WIDTH="292" HEIGHT="126" BORDER="0" ALIGN="TEXTTOP"></P>
<BR>
<P STYLE="border-bottom: thin black solid"><B>Assigning Vertices</B></P>
<P>Always perform the vertex assignments at frame zero. This is because the
assignment is made relative to the bones reference frame which is frame zero of
the animation.</P>
<BR>
<P STYLE="border-bottom: thin black solid"><B>Modifying The Mesh After Vertex
Assignment</B></P>
<P>Modifications to the mesh after assignment should be picked up automatically
by the modifier and the assignments updated. If this doesn't happen please let
me know.</P>
<P>There seems to be a problem with MAX temporarily losing internal references
inside the skin modifier if you make any mesh modifications. One way to prevent
this is before moving back to the skin modifier in the modify stack, select ALL
vertices in the Edit Mesh modifier. </P>
