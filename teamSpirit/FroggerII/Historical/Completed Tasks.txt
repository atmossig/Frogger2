BUG------------ facing forward enemies dont face forward

INSTANCE-------	ancients 1 spikes
SENT BY-------- Bruce
RESPONSIBILTY-- Jim
FIXED NOTES---- Hmm. If I make them always face along the first segment of the path, as they actually
				did at one time, all the existing ones have to be remapped. And it breaks some kinds
				of enemies, and may even cause some mappings to crash the game. So I'll have to leave
				it for now, and if it becomes a problem in other places then I'll have to do something.
