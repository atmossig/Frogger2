This folder contains Character Studio Biped motion files (.bip) created "by hand" and using motion capture data which can be imported directly.


The freeform folder contains animations that do not utilize Biped footsteps.

The footstep folder contains animations that are footstep-driven.

The Mocap folder contains raw motion capture data that can be imported into biped and filtered - either as free-form, or footstep animations, depending on the nature of the raw motion capture file.

Motion captured motions are organized in sub-folders by type
