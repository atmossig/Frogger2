This folder contains Motion Capture motions stored in Biped's internal ".bip" format.

All motion was originally was provided by Viewpoint DataLabs in the Biovision BVH format, and has been imported into Biped and converted into Biped .bip format.

All .bip motions contain a key-frame per frame, and can be treated as pure motion capture data and should be imported through the motion capture filtering feature in the motion capture rollout of Biped. (Raw .bip motions can also be read directly into Character Studio through the standard file open dialog as well).
