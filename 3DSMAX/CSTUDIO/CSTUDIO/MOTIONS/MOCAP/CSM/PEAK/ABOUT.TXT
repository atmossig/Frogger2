This folder contains raw motion capture data in the Character Studio Marker format (csm).  

These files can be imported in to Character Studio 2.0 using the Load MoCap button in the Motion Capture Rollout of Biped.

The Peak Performance Technologies, Inc. Motus system uses optical, marker-based motion capture and videotape-based tracking with stationary or moving cameras to allow a virtually unlimited capture space. Real life movements recorded indoors, outdoors, underwater, or in other natural environments can be easily used to create animated human or animal characters.

Peak has been supplying motion capture systems to industry, the biological sciences, biomedical research, and sport science for over ten years.  Our products are currently used in over twenty-five countries.

The Peak Motus system integrates three types of motion capture.  These include:

Basic Video System: 15/30Hz-video motion capture for outdoors or non-complex movements, in 2D or 3D.

Advanced Video System: This higher resolution, field-accurate system provides a platform that can expand to include tracking motion with or without reflective markers from videotape, pan & tilt (to capture large areas), and high-speed cameras for slow-motion effects.  This is particularly good for complex outdoor sport motions or for motions that cannot use markers (animals, children, swimming, stuntmen, etc.).

Optical Motion Capture  System: The Peak Motus optical coordinate capture system uses 4 to 12 cameras to track the coordinate position of reflective markers in a studio space.  This provides a fast process to capture standard motions such as walking, running, many sports and so forth.

All modules can be integrated to provide the best solution to fit the needs of any animation project.
