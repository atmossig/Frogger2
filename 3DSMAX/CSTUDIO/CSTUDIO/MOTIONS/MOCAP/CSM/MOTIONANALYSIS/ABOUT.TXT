This Motion Analysis Corporation CSM data was captured with a ten camera 
system at Modern Uprising Studios in New York City.  Files were captured 
for Riverbed's "Biped" project with Merce Cunningham. In the duet data, 
both dancers were captured at the same time. 

These files can be imported into Character Studio using the "Load Motion
Capture File" button in the Motion Capture Rollout of Biped. First load 
the MNM marker mapping name file followed by the CSM motion capture 
file. Please reference the Character Studio manual and documentation for 
more information on CSM motion capture data.
