This folder contains sample Motion File Editor files ".mfe" for Character Studio 2.0.  These files contain scripts  that organize and blend sample Biped ".bip" files.  These files can be read in Character Studio 2.0 Biped using the Motion Flow Mode tools, located on the Biped Motion panel.  Choose Load File from within the Motion Flow Mode tool area to read a .mfe file from this folder.

All .bip files referenced by these samples .mfe files are stored in this folder for convenience.

Use the MoflowDir variable to change the default search location for all mfe-referenced .bip files.

The MoFlowDir variable is set in the Biped biped.ini file stored in the MAX\plugcfg folder.

Biped will automatically create a default biped.ini file in the plugcfg folder if one does not already exist.  The MoFlowDir variable will be set by default to:

MoFlowDir=D:\Max2\cstudio\scripts
