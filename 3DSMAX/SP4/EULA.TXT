The Windows NT Service Pack 4 ("Service Pack") contains updates to Windows NT and the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack ("Updated Software"), as well as a few new components ("New Components").  

The Updated Software is licensed to you under the same terms and conditions contained in the End User License Agreement ("EULA") you received with Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 or Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 (hereafter collectively "Windows NT 4.0") and/or the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack.  If you do not agree to be bound by the terms of the EULA, you are not authorized to use the Updated Software.

If you have multiple validly licensed copies of Windows NT 4.0 and/or the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack, you may reproduce, install and use one copy of the Updated Software on all of your computers running validly licensed copies of Windows NT 4.0 and/or the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack provided that you use such additional copies of the Updated Software in accordance with the terms and conditions above. For each validly licensed copy of Windows NT 4.0 or Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack, you also may reproduce one additional copy of the Updated Software solely for archival purposes or reinstallation of the Updated Software on the same computer as the Updated Software was previously installed.  Microsoft retains all right, title and interest in and to the Updated Software.  All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Microsoft.

The Updated Software may contain technology that enables applications to be shared between two or more computers, even if an application is installed on only one of the computers.  You may use this technology with all Microsoft application products for multi-party conferences.  For non-Microsoft applications, you should consult the accompanying license agreement or contact the licensor to determine whether application sharing is permitted by the licensor.

The New Components are licensed to you under the terms and conditions contained in the EULA which accompanies each New Component.  You must read and accept the terms of each such EULA before you access or use the New Components.  If you do not agree to the terms of any such EULA, you are not authorized to use the corresponding New Component(s).  

If you obtain the Service Pack on CD-ROM, you may be granted distribution rights for certain files identified in a "redist.txt" file included with such media.  You must obtain the Service Pack on a Microsoft CD-ROM and review the redist.txt file before you exercise any of the rights described therein.  By exercising any such right, you agree to be bound by the terms described in the redist.txt file.  If the redist.txt file is not included with the Service Pack, you have no distribution rights to any portion of the Service Pack.  If you do not agree to the terms described in the redist.txt file, you are not authorized to redistribute any of the files.  

EXPORT RESTRICTIONS
The North American (128 bit) version of Service Pack 4 is intended for distribution only in the United States and Canada.  Effective January 1, 1997, export of this Service Pack from the United States is regulated under "EI controls" of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR, 15 CFR 730-744) of the U.S. Commerce Department, Bureau of Export Administration (BXA). EI controls are the current equivalent of ITAR munitions export controls that previously applied to this product. EI controls require that you obtain a Commerce export license prior to any export, transmission or shipment of this product to any country, other than Canada, or to any person, entity, or end user subject to U.S. export restrictions. For further information, the Commerce export license process and EI controls are described on BXA's Web site at http://www.bxa.doc.gov/encstart.htm.  You agree that you will not directly or indirectly, export or re-export North American Service Pack 4 (or portions thereof) to any country, other than Canada, or to any person, entity or end user subject to U.S. export restrictions without first obtaining a Commerce Department export license.  You warrant and represent that neither the BXA nor any other U.S. federal agency has suspended, revoked or denied your export privileges.
